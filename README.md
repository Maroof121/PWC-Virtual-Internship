# PWC-Virtual-Internship


## I recently participated in PwC's virtual job simulation on the Forage platform,
## and it was incredibly useful to learn about how to use PowerBI more effectively.
## I practiced creating a Power BI dashboard for visualizing key performance
## indicators (KPIs) and metrics.
## Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working with data visualization
## using Microsoft PowerBI for diversity and inclusion in the corporate world, and
## I’m excited to apply these skills at a company like PwC.
